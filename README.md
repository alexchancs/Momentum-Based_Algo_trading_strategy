# Momentum-Based_Algo_trading_strategy

This project demonstrates the development and backtesting of a Momentum-Based Algorithmic Trading Strategy. This goal is to identify favorable buy and sell signals in financial markets by leveraging momentum indicators like Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) and Relative Strength Index (RSI). These indicators help capture trends and reversals, enabling us to make informed trading decisions.

By using historical data from Yahoo Finance and the Backtrader framework, this project replicates a real-world trading environment allowing us to backtest the strategy's effectiveness over time.
